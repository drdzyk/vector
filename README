This is an implementation of STL vector. There are a few differences though:
1) get_allocator() returns allocator by const ref, not by value
2) back(), front(), swap() are always noexcept

Not implemented:
  *  assign(std::size_t count, cont T &value)
  *  assign(std::initializer_list<T> ilist)
  *  max_size()
  *  emplace()

Requirements: catch2, clang >= 9 or gcc >= 9.

Build and run:
cmake .
make
make test
